/*
  The default value for position is static
*/

/*
  When using any non-default position value, we need to supply height and width, float, top, left, bottom or right.

/*
  The inferred display value of an element that has been positioned is display block.

/*
  One of the non-default values for position still maintains a box in the flow of the document. It is fixed.
*/

/*
  The special or significant about fixed and sticky positioning is that they behave both like a relative position.
*/

/*
  We use the positioning attributes top, left, bottom. and right to set the location.
*/

/*
  Absolute position layout is used to make the position of the element relative to only its parent(non-static position element). (TheStartup)
*/

/*
  Sometimes if you put two absolutely positioned elements in the same physical space, they'll stack, i.e. only one will be visible on top. What are the rules here? Why is a certain element on top? How can we adjust that ourselves:
  Absolute with non-static parent so we need absolute with parent position non-static

/*
Stacking context refers to how elements on a webpage appear to sit on top of other elements, just as you can arrange index cards on your desk to lie side-by-side or overlap each other.(mdn)
