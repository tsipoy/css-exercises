/* The calc function */

/*
  1. Calc function can support length, frequency, angle, time, percentage, number, or integer, fraction, string.
*/

/*
  2.  How can we control the mathematical order of operation (PEDMAS / BODMAS) in the function, so that something like `calc(2 + 3 * 4)` doesn't equal `20`, when it is instead meant to equal `14`?
  -> We should calculate the calc like this, calc((2 + 5) * 4)
*/

/*
  3. Yes, we can use cal function to convert one type of unit to another type of unit.
  Do the work in primitive first (100 * 1px)
*/

/*
  4. You have to add the unitless number with a unit number. For example, calc(2 * 1rem), it equals 2rem.
*/

/*
  5. Why do the *plus* and *minus* operators inside the function need spaces around them?
  If we don't use spaces aound them, the number change into negative or positive.
*/

/*
  6. If we want to convert a value into a negative value, we need to put negative number.
*/

/*
  7. It works with some browsers like firefox, safari but it doesn't work with some like chrome or opera.
