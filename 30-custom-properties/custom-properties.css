/* Custom Properties */

/*
  1. We have to use "--" when defining a Custom Property's name in the root, underscore we have to use var() function to make our custun properties variable in the selector and it must finish with ";".
*/

/*
  2. We can't use space in Custum Properties but instead we use a dash to separete the name, we also can't use fullstop and period.
*/

/*
  3. Possible values we can assign to a new Custom Property are text with ("") px, %, rem, and number.
*/

/*
  4. It is useful because custom properties are scoped on the elements they have declared on and it isn't useful if we want to share a variable that have different values.
*/

/*
  5. After we've defined a new Custom Property for example --example-one: green; , we use the var() fuction and we put the new custon property inside the bracket but we have to set the property like background-color: var(--example-one);
*/

/*
  6. There are several ways to override or change a Custom Property:
     change it in the selector, @media query and :root
*/

/*
  7. Custom Properties are useful because:  - we don't need to write long codes
                                            - it reduces repeated values
                                            - it used to stores specified values
                                            - we can adjust a single value in the shorthand property very easily(css{In Real Life})
                                            - 1 point of control
*/

/*
  8. What is the only aspect (or part) of CSS syntax that we can use Custom Properties for
     -> declaration block
*/
